      <h1>Best Types for the PKMN TCG</h1>
      <p>The best Pokemon types for the Pokemon TCG include: psychic, electric, and steel.
        The reason these types were picked were because of it's stats, abilities, resistances, weaknesses, and
        effectiveness on other Pokemon. As you may find on most competitive cards in the TCG, cards that play well
        have abilities and Pokebodies.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div id="psychic">
      <h3>Psychic:</h3>
      <p>Psychic type Pokemon are easily playable in the TCG because that specific type Pokemon has very few weaknesses,
        being Rock,
        and Steel. On the contrary, they are very efficient against any other types, especially when they use
        their charms like sleep or confusion.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecenter">
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/Mewtwo&MewGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="psychic_image" src="images/Mewtwo&MewGX.jpg" alt="Mewtwo&MewGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>
          Mewtwo & Mew GX was probably one of the best picks for the meta. With it's ability
          "Perfection," it was able to use any attack on your bench and discarded pile (with necessary energy.) 
          This proved useful because Mewtwo & Mew's other attack required 3 energy and could only ever be used once. 
          Psychic pokemons' weaknesses are itself which is an advantage and disadvantage in it of itself.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/TapuLeleGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="psychic_image" src="images/TapuLeleGX.jpg" alt="TapuLeleGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>
          TapuLele GX is well known for it's ability "Wonder Tag." This ability allows you to search your deck for any supporter card,
          reveal it, put it in your hand, and shuffle the deck. This is very useful because it doesn't require any energy and it doesn't count 
          as a turn.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/NecrozmaGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a><img id="psychic_image" src="images/NecrozmaGX.jpg" alt="NecrozmaGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Necrozma is mostly used for it's "Light's End" ability. This ability allows
          the pokemon to be immune to colorless type attacks. This is especially useful 
          against meta decks like Oranguru and Snorlax.
        </p>   
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/LunalaGX.jpeg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="psychic_image" src="images/LunalaGX.jpeg" alt="LunalaGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Lunala GX is easily playable with it's ability, "Psychic Transfer. It can allows
          you to move a psychic energy from one of your pokemon to a different pokemon. This is 
          is especially usefull when you want to do a surprise attack on someone."</p>   
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/Malamar.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="psychic_image" src="images/Malamar.jpg" alt="Malamar" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Malamar is a particularly good pokemon in the tcg overall, but this one stands out 
          from all the rest. With it's ability, "Psychic Recharge" Malamar is able to summon a psychic 
          energy from the discard pile onto any one of your pokemon either benched or active.
        </p>   
      </div>
    </div>  

    <div id="electric">
      <h3>Electric:</h3>
      <p>Electric type pokemon are the most popular because they are the most balanced. What this means is,
        since Electric can be harmed by so many types, it was given a lot of abilities and resistances to
        offset and balance it. A great example is Pikachu & Zekrom Tag Team GX because it's ability is very reliable when paired with
        cards like Zeroara GX and Tapu-Lele GX.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecenter">
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/PikachuZekromGX.jpeg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="electric_image" src="images/PikachuZekromGX.jpeg" alt="Pikachu-Zekrom-GX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>&nbsp; Pikachu & Zekrom (or Pikarom). The beast. With it's attack Full Blitz, only requiring 3 energy,
          Zekrom is especially popular when paired with cards like Zeroara and Dedenne. It's
        very reliable in pairs because other cards can swap energies with Pikarom and deal massive damage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/ZeroaraGXfa.jpg" target="_blank" ></a><img id="electric_image" src="images/ZeroaraGXfa.jpg" alt="ZeraoraGXfa" width="200" height="280">
        <p> Zeroara GX is mainly used as a support because of it's ability "Thunderclap Zone," which allows 
          all electric type pokemon to retreat during that turn without a retreat cost. This card is really annoying but reliable
          when paired with Pikarom.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/TapuKokoGX.jpeg" target="_blank" ></a><img id="electric_image" src="images/TapuKokoGX.jpeg" alt="TapuKokoGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Tapu Koko GX is very exciting and strong when played, because of it's ability,
          "Aero Trail." This ability allows Tapu Koko, (when placed from your hand onto your bench), to take any amount of energies
          from other pokemon on your bench or active, and replace Tapu Koko with the active pokemon.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/DedenneGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="electric_image" src="images/DedenneGX.jpg" alt="DedenneGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Dedenne GX is the best way to go if your hand has pokemon you don't really need. Dedenne's ability
          "Dedechange" allows you to discard the cards in your hand and draw 6 cards. This is especially helpful when 
          your hand has a few cards. This is probably the card with the best ability in the game, because no conditions apply
          when you use this ability.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/VikavoltGX.jpeg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="electric_image" src="images/VikavoltGX.jpeg" alt="VikavoltGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Vikavolt GX, having massive health, is mostly used as a shield.
          It can be paired with Tapu-Koko or Pikarom to devistate the opponent with massive amounts of damage.
        </p> 
      </div>
    </div>
    <div id="steel">
      <h3>Steel:</h3>
      <p>Steel type pokemon are very reliable in the tcg due to pokemon of that type having not any weaknesses.
        Taking one look at them,
        you realize they are an impenetrable force. From steel talons to steel shells, pokemon like Magnezone
        and Jirachi, have unique abilities
        to protect themselves.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="imagecenter">
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/Jirachi Card.jpeg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="steel_image" src="images/Jirachi Card.jpeg" alt="Jirachi" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Jirachi is probably the best metal type pokemon around. It's ability "Stellar Wish" allows
          you to look at the top 5 cards in your deck, show your opponent the 5 cards, take out 1 trainer card and put it in your hand
          (if there is any) and shuffle the rest of the cards into your deck. This ability also makes the pokemon
          asleep after used. Though the pokemon is asleep after use, the trainer can be put the trainer on any pokemon. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/Magnezone Card.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="steel_image" src="images/Magnezone Card.jpg" alt="Magnezone" width="200" height="280">
        <p>This magnezone's ability "Magnetic Circuit" allows the card to attach any number metal energy 
          from your hand onto the pokemon. This is extemely useful because normally you can only attach 1
          energy per turn. 
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/ZacianV.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="steel_image" src="images/ZacianV.jpg" alt="ZacianV" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Zacian V is probably the best card to use in a deck because of it's ability
          "Intrepid Sword." This ability allows the user to take the top 3 cards of your deck
          and put any number of energies on your Zacian V, and the rest in your hand. The downside of 
          this ability is that your turn ends after it.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/MetagrossGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a> <img id="steel_image" src="images/MetagrossGX.jpg" alt="MetagrossGX" width="200" height="280">
        <p>This pokemon is especially powerful because it allows you to attach a psychic or metal
          energy from your discard pile onto your active pokemon. This is especially useful since you can't 
          reuse your energies, and they get sent to the discard pile.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image-card">
        <a href="images/Lucario&MelmetalGX.jpg" target="_blank" ></a><img id="steel_image" src="images/Lucario&MelmetalGX.jpg" alt="Lucario" width="200" height="280">
        <p>Lucario&Melmetal GX is a very powerful pokemon. With it's 260 health it is one of the highest HP pokemon in the game. 
          With it's GX attack "Full Metal Wall GX" all of the user's metal pokemon take 30 less damage after an attack. Also, if 
          this pokemon has an additional energy attached to it (in addition to it's attack cost,) your opponent removes all their energy 
          on their active pokemon.
